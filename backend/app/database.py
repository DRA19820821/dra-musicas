"""
Database connection and session management using SQLAlchemy.

This module defines a SQLAlchemy Engine and SessionLocal for database
connections. By default it uses SQLite for ease of development, but the
connection URL can be overridden via the `DATABASE_URL` environment
variable. When deploying with Docker Compose the environment can be
configured to point at a Postgres instance instead.

The Base class defined here should be used by all ORM models in
``models.py`` to ensure they share the same metadata.
